# Zero to DevOps!

This repo contains the source code for the "zero to DevOps" talk given at DevOps Connect 2016. The basic idea is to create, using Ansible, a complete end-to-end pipeline with the Flaskr python example. This includes running python based unit tests and as an added bonus executing ```behave``` BDD tests.
